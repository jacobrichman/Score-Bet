This PHP code will allow a user to enter in score predictions for a sporting event and it will calculate the closest estimate.

The code works by ranking each prediction for each team. The ranking for each team estimate is added up and the person with the highest total rank for both teams has the closest prediction.

This code prevents people from just guessing a score total (allowing the score to be reversed). Here each person's estimate must be aligned to a specific team.
